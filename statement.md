Problem Statement:
In the modern digital landscape, news consumers are often faced with an abundance of information that is difficult to navigate and filter effectively. This saturation results in inefficient news consumption, as generic feeds frequently fail to deliver content that is specifically relevant to the user's immediate domain of interest.
The core problem the Smart News Assistant addresses is the critical gap in personalization and specificity within conventional news delivery systems.
A robust, interactive system is needed to overcome the limitations of passive aggregation. Currently, users lack an intuitive tool capable of integrating two key filtering dimensions quickly and accurately:
1. Lack of Domain Focus: Existing methods do not typically provide an active interface that asks the user directly about which domain news they want. This results in users receiving broad, generalized results rather than targeted information.
2. Insufficient Language Customization: While global news is available, systems often default to a primary language or require burdensome configuration. There is a clear requirement for an application that prompts the user for which language they prefer, allowing the user to select their desired language (such as English, Hindi, or Marathi, as detailed in our conversation).
The Smart News Assistant, a solution made in python, is designed to solve this by providing a dedicated, two-step questioning process (domain and language inquiry). This process ensures that the ultimate output of the code is highly targeted and relevant: the news about the entered topic.

Scope of the Project:
The scope of this project is to create a focused, interactive tool for customized news retrieval.
Primary Objectives and Functionality
The main objective of this project is to serve as a smart news assistant made in python. The core scope is defined by the following interactive steps and resulting output:
1. Domain Customization: The assistant must interact with the user by asking questions about which domain news the user wants. This defines the specific subject matter (topic) of the news output.
2. Language Specification: The scope includes a mandatory requirement for language selection. The assistant asks for which language, and the user has to select the language before proceeding.
3. Targeted Output Delivery: The project is successfully completed when the output of the code is the news about the entered topic, presented according to the language selected by the user.
In summary, the scope is limited to providing a streamlined Python-based interface that captures domain and language preferences from the user and delivers the corresponding filtered news results.

Target Users:
This Python Smart News Assistant is designed for users who require highly filtered and customizable news retrieval. The key target users include:
1. Users Seeking Specific Domain Information This project is ideal for individuals (such as researchers, analysts, or enthusiasts) who only want to receive news related to a singular topic.
• Users can specify the exact domain news they want, ensuring the output focuses only on the entered topic.
2. Multilingual Readers and Language Learners A crucial feature of the assistant is the mandatory language selection.
• Users who need to access news in languages other than their system default.
• Individuals practicing a second language who need specific, relevant content in that language (since the user has to select the language).
3. Programmers and CLI Enthusiasts Since the tool is a smart news assistant made in python, target users include those who prefer running utilities from a command-line interface or integrating Python scripts into their existing workflows.
In summary, the target user is anyone who values control over both the subject matter and the language of their news feed.

High-Level Features:
This Smart News Assistant provides users with targeted news results through an interactive and customizable experience.
1. Python-Based Development: The project is a smart news assistant made in python.
2. Interactive Query System: The assistant is designed to guide the user by asking questions to determine their preferences.
3. Domain-Specific Filtering: Users gain control over the content as the assistant asks questions about which domain news the user wants.
4. Mandatory Language Selection: The tool requires language input, as it asks for which language and the user has to select the language.
5. Targeted Output Delivery: The core outcome of the program is the highly relevant news, where the output of the code is the news about the entered topic.

   
Functional Requirements:
I. User Interaction and Input
1. System Initialization: The system shall initiate the user interface by displaying a clear welcoming message (e.g., "=== SMART NEWS ASSISTANT ===").
2. Domain Inquiry: The system must ask questions about which domain news the user wants, prompting the user to "Enter topic you want news about".
3. Program Termination: The system shall recognize the input "exit" as a command to terminate the assistant gracefully.
4. Language Inquiry: Following the topic entry, the system must ask for which language the user prefers.
5. Language Selection: The system must present specific language choices: English, Hindi, and Marathi.
6. Language Mapping: The system must map the user's input (1, 2, or 3) to the corresponding API codes ("en," "hi," or "mr") and default to English ("en") if an invalid choice is made.
II. Data Retrieval and Processing
7. API Integration: The system must utilize the Python requests library to connect to an external news service (NewsAPI.org).
8. Query Construction: The system must construct an API request using the user-entered topic as the search query (q) and the selected language.
9. Result Sorting: The system must request that the news articles be sorted by publishedAt .
10. Error Handling (HTTP): The system must check the HTTP response status code; if the status is not 200, the system must print a specific error message reporting the status code .
III. Output and Display
11. Core Output: The system must provide the news about the entered topic as the final result
12. Article Limitation: The system shall limit the output display to a maximum of five articles per query.
13. Information Display: For each returned article, the system must clearly print the article's title and its corresponding URL.
14. No News Handling: If the API returns no articles for the specified topic and language, the system must report that "No news found for this topic"


Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):
The non-functional requirements (NFRs) describe the criteria that define the quality, performance, and operational environment of the Smart News Assistant, rather than its specific features.
Here are the non-functional requirements for the Smart News Assistant, drawing upon its described architecture and implementation details:

1. Performance and Efficiency
• Response Time: The system shall execute the API call and return the article titles and URLs to the user promptly following the final language selection.
• Data Load Management: To maintain efficiency, the system must limit the displayed output to the top 5 articles per query.
• External Dependency Reliance: The overall performance of the news fetching process is dependent on the availability and speed of the external NewsAPI.org service.
2. Reliability and Robustness
• API Availability: The system must be capable of handling failures in communication with the news provider by checking the HTTP status code [Query]. If the status code is not 200, the system must print an appropriate error message.
• Data Integrity: The system must be able to recognize and report scenarios where the query yields no relevant results by displaying the message "No news found for this topic".
• Default Behavior: If a user enters an invalid language choice, the system must maintain operational stability by defaulting the language setting to English ("en").
3. Usability
• Conversational Flow: The interaction must be simple and sequential, following the pattern of asking for the topic first, then presenting the language options, thus ensuring a clear, guided user experience.
• Clarity of Prompts: Input prompts (e.g., "Enter topic you want news about") and menu selections must be clear and easily understood by the user.
• Exit Mechanism: The system must provide a defined, simple method for the user to terminate the program (entering "exit").
4. Technology and Maintainability
• Platform: The assistant must be developed and runnable in the Python environment.
• Code Structure: The system should utilize well-structured and widely supported libraries, such as the requests library, to ensure maintainability and readability.
• API Security: Access to news data must be secured through the required use of a valid API Key during all external data requests 
The Smart News Assistant system follows a simple, three-tiered architecture that facilitates interactive user input, data processing, and external API communication. The entire system is made in Python.

System Architecture:
1. Presentation and Interaction Layer (User Input)
This layer handles all direct communication with the user and focuses on gathering the necessary parameters for the news retrieval.
• Sequential Interaction: The assistant initiates a conversational flow.
• Domain Capture: The system first prompts the user to enter the specific topic for which they want news. This fulfills the requirement of asking questions about which domain news the user wants.
• Language Capture: The assistant then explicitly asks for which language the user prefers, presenting a menu that includes options for English, Hindi, and Marathi.
• Program Control: This layer also accepts the "exit" command to terminate the program.
2. Application and Logic Layer (Python Core)
This layer represents the processing engine, implemented using Python. It performs the necessary translations, communication construction, and basic error checks.
• API Client: The system utilizes the requests library to manage external communication.
• Parameter Preparation: It maps the user's language selection (1, 2, 3) to the appropriate language codes ("en," "hi," or "mr").
• Request Construction: A request is built incorporating the user's topic and chosen language. The logic also specifies that the results should be sorted by publishedAt.
• Error Checking: The logic validates the response from the external service by checking the HTTP status code (expecting 200) and reporting errors if communication fails.
3. Data Source and Retrieval Layer
This external layer provides the raw news data necessary for the application.
• External Service: The core data source is the NewsAPI.org service.
• Specific Endpoint: The system connects specifically to the /v2/everything endpoint of this service.
• API Key Management: Access to this external service is secured through the use of a predefined API Key.
4. Output Layer (Presentation)
After receiving and processing the data, this layer handles the formatting and display of the results to the user.
• Final Output: This layer delivers the news about the entered topic.
• Limitation: It limits the display to the top 5 articles.
• Information Display: For each article, it prints the title and the corresponding URL.
• Data Integrity Feedback: If no results are available, it displays the message "No news found for this topic".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The architecture functions like a specialized translator operating within a pipeline: the user speaks their interests (topic and language) to the Python core, which translates that request into the specific format needed by the external news service. The news service sends the raw data back, and the Python core then filters and formats the results before delivering the highly specific news back to the user.


Design decision and Rationale:
The design of the Smart News Assistant is centred on creating a highly personalized and efficient news retrieval system. The decisions made regarding architecture, technology, and data handling are directly aimed at fulfilling the system's core requirement: providing the news about the entered topic based on user-specified filters.

Implementation details:
The implementation details of the Smart News Assistant cover the specific technology, libraries, functions, and logical steps used to gather user input and fetch news data. The entire project is made in python.
1. Technology Stack and External Dependencies
• Programming Language: The Smart News Assistant is implemented entirely in Python.
• External Library: The system relies on the requests library to handle all HTTP communication with the external data source.
• API Service: The data is sourced from NewsAPI.org, specifically using the /v2/everything endpoint.
• Security: Access to the API is secured using a predefined API Key.
2. Core Functional Implementation
The assistant's logic is structured around two primary Python functions: smart_news_assistant() for user interaction and get_news() for data fetching.
A. User Interaction (smart_news_assistant function)
1. Continuous Operation: The interaction runs within a while True loop to allow the user to perform multiple searches without restarting the program.
2. Domain Input: The system prompts the user to "Enter topic you want news about", thereby asking questions about which domain news the user wants.
3. Exit Mechanism: If the user inputs "exit", the loop breaks, and the program terminates gracefully.
4. Language Input: The user is presented with a fixed menu of languages: 1. English, 2. Hindi, and 3. Marathi 
5. Language Mapping: User input (1, 2, or 3) is converted to the API language codes via the lang_map: "en", "hi", or "mr". If the input is invalid, the language defaults to "en".
B. Data Retrieval (get_news function)
1. Parameter Construction: The function dynamically builds a dictionary of parameters for the API call, including the user's topic (mapped to q), the selected language, the API Key, and specifies that results should be sorted by publishedAt.
2. API Execution: The requests.get() method is used to send the request to the NewsAPI URL.
3. Error Handling and Output Implementation
1. HTTP Error Check: The system verifies the success of the API call by checking if the response.status_code is 200. If it is not successful, an error message detailing the status code is printed.
2. No News Found: If the API returns successfully but the article list is empty, the system prints "No news found for this topic".
3. Output Presentation: If articles are available, the output of the code is the news about the entered topic. The function iterates over the list of articles, displaying a maximum of the first five articles found.
4. Information Display: For each of the displayed articles, the system prints the title and the URL 

Testing Approach:
Based on the documented features, architecture, and implementation details of the Smart News Assistant, the testing approach should be focused on verifying its core functionalities: sequential user interaction, accurate parameter passing, successful API integration, and correct output generation.
The testing approach would primarily involve Functional Testing and Non-Functional Testing (focusing on reliability and usability).
I. Functional Testing Approach
The main goal is to confirm that the assistant, made in Python, correctly implements the defined logic and provides the news about the entered topic.
II. Non-Functional Testing Approach (Reliability)
This focuses on verifying the system's robustness against common failure points, as implemented in the Python code 

Challenges faced:
1. External Dependency Challenges
• API Reliability and Access: The assistant relies entirely on the NewsAPI.org service. A significant challenge is ensuring that the external API remains available, fast, and consistent. Any downtime, changes to the API structure, or issues with the required API Key would render the entire assistant non-functional.
• Rate Limiting: Since the system uses a third-party API, managing the volume of requests to avoid hitting rate limits is a constant challenge, particularly if the assistant is used frequently by multiple users or deployed publicly.
2. Data and Retrieval Challenges
• Accuracy of Results: Ensuring that the news about the entered topic is highly accurate and relevant is challenging. The quality of the results depends entirely on the NewsAPI's indexing and sorting algorithms, which may not always perfectly match the user's specific intent.
• Linguistic Limitations: The assistant currently only supports three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi). Expanding language support requires verifying that the NewsAPI provides reliable content for additional languages and mapping new codes accurately, which can be challenging if reliable codes or content are unavailable.
• Result Limitation: A design decision limits the output to only the top 5 articles. While this aids usability, a challenge is that genuinely important or relevant articles may be missed if they fall outside this top five ranking.
• Sorting Challenges: Although the system requests results sorted by publishedAt, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery of the most recent data depends on the external service's ability to index and update content instantly.
3. User Interaction and Input Challenges
• Ambiguity in Topic Input: The system asks questions about which domain news the user wants and requires a text input for the topic. Users may input ambiguous terms, broad categories, or misspelled keywords, leading to poor or non-existent results, triggering the "No news found for this topic" error.
• Input Validation: Although the system handles invalid language choices by defaulting to English, validating the quality and complexity of the user's topic input remains a challenge to maximize the relevance of the search.
• User Experience in a Console Environment: Operating in a simple console interface means the system lacks graphical elements, making it challenging to present large amounts of data clearly or offer complex user feedback beyond simple printed statements

Learnings & Key Takeaways:
The development and implementation of the Smart News Assistant yield several important learnings and key technical takeaways, focused on effective personalization and robust external integration.
I. Core Project Validation and Personalization
The primary takeaway is the successful validation of the core project concept:
• Effectiveness of Sequential Filtering: The project successfully demonstrated that a simple, two-step interactive process is highly effective for personalization. By first asking questions about which domain news the user wants, and then asking for which language, the system ensures the final output is highly targeted.
• Achieving the Core Goal: The assistant successfully implemented the function to provide the news about the entered topic based on the user's specific linguistic needs (e.g., English, Hindi, Marathi), validating the utility of focused data retrieval over generic feeds.
II. Technical and Implementation Learnings
The implementation decisions provide specific technical lessons regarding API integration and coding best practices:
• Python's Strength in Connectivity: The project validated the choice of having the assistant made in python, demonstrating that the language, coupled with the requests library, is ideal for rapidly building reliable external API clients.
• Importance of API Parameterization: A key learning was the necessity of correctly parameterizing external calls. Specifying the topic (q), language, and ensuring the data is sorted by publishedAt were crucial steps to guarantee the relevance and timeliness of the results.
• Controlled Output for Performance: A learning in design was the effectiveness of limiting results. By constraining the display to the top 5 articles (showing only the title and URL), the system enhances both usability and overall performance, preventing information overload.
III. System Robustness and Error Management
Developing a system dependent on an external service highlighted the importance of robust internal controls:
• Graceful Dependency Management: The implementation of checks for the HTTP status code demonstrated the necessity of handling potential communication failures with the external NewsAPI.org service. This prevents program crashes and provides clear feedback to the user.
• Handling Empty Datasets: A key takeaway was the need to account for search criteria that yield zero results. The mechanism to detect and report "No news found for this topic" ensures that the system remains stable and informative even when the topic or language combination is too specific.
• Input Reliability: The decision to default the language to "en" when an invalid input is provided is a critical lesson in improving system reliability by building safeguards against unexpected user actions.

Future Enhancements:
Based on the current implementation and scope of the Smart News Assistant, which is made in Python and focuses on retrieving the news about the entered topic based on domain and language filters, several enhancements can be proposed to increase its functionality, robustness, and personalization.
Here are future enhancements for the Smart News Assistant:
1. Expanded Personalization and Filtering
• Source Filtering: Enhance the domain inquiry to allow the user to specify or exclude certain news sources (e.g., "only news from major financial sites"). This would provide a more precise filter beyond just the topic.
• Time-based Filtering: Implement an option for the user to request news within a specific time frame (e.g., news published in the last 24 hours or the last week). This utilizes the current system's ability to sort by publishedAt 
• Multi-Language Support Expansion: While the assistant currently supports English, Hindi, and Marathi, future development could expand the language menu to include more global options, increasing the application's reach.
2. Output and Display Improvements
• Output Details: Currently, the system only displays the title and URL for the top 5 articles. An enhancement could include displaying a brief snippet or summary of the article alongside the title and URL to help the user better judge relevance before navigating away.
• Customizable Output Limit: Allow the user to specify how many articles they want to see (e.g., 5, 10, or 20) instead of the fixed limit of five.
3. Robustness and Usability Enhancements
• Advanced Error Feedback: Improve the existing error handling (which reports non-200 HTTP status codes or "No news found for this topic") to offer more helpful diagnostics. For example, suggesting ways to broaden the topic if no results are found.
• Input Validation for Topics: Implement better validation or suggestion mechanisms for the topic input to handle misspellings or ambiguous terms, reducing the likelihood of zero-result searches.
• Configuration File for API Key: Instead of hardcoding the API Key directly in the source code, future development should move this sensitive information to a separate configuration file (e.g., .env or YAML) for improved security and maintainability.
4. Persistence and Automation
• Saving Preferences: Implement a feature to save the user's preferred domain and language settings, eliminating the need to re-enter them for every session.
• Scheduled Reporting: Introduce a mechanism to run the news assistant automatically at predefined intervals and perhaps output the results to a file or a simple notification system, turning it from a reactive tool into a proactive one.
